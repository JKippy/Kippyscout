Creating a website for an FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) scouting application using React is a great project! Here's a high-level overview of how you can approach this:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed, as it comes with npm (Node Package Manager).

Create a New React App:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app frc-scouting
cd frc-scouting
Install Necessary Packages: You'll need packages for routing, state management, and authentication. Common choices include:

bash
Copy code
npm install react-router-dom axios firebase
Step 2: Set Up Routing
Use react-router-dom to create multiple pages in your application.

--------------------------------------
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';
import Login from './pages/Login';
import Scouting from './pages/Scouting';
import Matches from './pages/Matches';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/login" component={Login} />
        <Route path="/scouting" component={Scouting} />
        <Route path="/matches" component={Matches} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
